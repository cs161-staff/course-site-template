# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.github_repo }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.


#######################################################
# Config you may need to change once per semester     #

# Jekyll default variables.
# For the title on the homepage, the name people see in the browser tab, etc.
title: "Course Name"
description: "Course Name at School Name"

# Jekyll default variable.
# The subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
#
# Example: If you build your site to inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp25,
#          then this should say "/~cs188/sp25"
# Example: If you build your site to sp25.cs161.org,
#          then this should say "" since there is no subpath
baseurl: ""

# Jekyll default variable.
# The full URL of your homepage.
url: "https://template.cs161.org"

# Can be used throughout the website (e.g. project specs).
#
# Example: In the spec, write "Pull from the skeleton-{{ site.semester_slug }} repo."
# This will automatically update to "skeleton-fa24" or "skeleton-sp25" each semester.
semester_slug: sp25
semester_full: Spring 2025

# Updates the top line of the homepage.
# Example: "Instructor: EvanBot / Lecture: Date Time, Location [Zoom, Playlist]"

      name: "Location"

# If your lecture slides are PDFs in this repo, update this.
lecture_prefix: "csXXX-sp25-lec"

# Used on staff.md to show students the staff email.
staff_email: "evanbot@berkeley.edu"

discussions_under_construction: false

# Set this to true to archive the semester and show a warning on every page.
outdated: false

# - If you set outdated, what is the latest site URL that we should link to?
# - Ideally this is a URL that always redirects to your current semester, e.g.
#   https://cs161.org or https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188
# - This is only used in _layouts/page.html and _layouts/project.html.

# Instructions for updating website #
#####################################

# Discussion filepaths are all formatted based on the discussion number.
# Pad discussion numbers, e.g. discussion 2 uses "02", not "2".
# For example, the files for discussion 2 should be placed at:
#   - /assets/discussions/disc02-regular.pdf
#   - /assets/discussions/disc02-regular-sols.pdf
#   - /assets/discussions/disc02-examprep.pdf
#   - /assets/discussions/disc02-examprep-sols.pdf

# To upload discussion worksheets and solutions to the website, just
# put the files in assets/discussions using the filenames above.

# If you need to manually put something in the discussion cell
# (e.g. links to multiple worksheets for exam review weeks), there's
# an override field that you can use. Anything you put in the override
# field will be converted to Markdown.

# Each element in the array corresponds to one box on the website.
# This includes boxes that are blank or don't have a discussion.
# By default, each box spans 2 rows (edit the default in syllabus.yml).
# To override this, use the "rowspan" attribute to resize a box.

# The website automatically numbers each element in the array.
# To skip numbering (e.g. for a "no discussion" box), add
# "nonumber: True" as an attribute.

# We currently assume that every week has both regular and exam-prep
# sections. If that's not true, update discussion.html.

# If released=True, the worksheet will populate
# If regular_video has a link and sols_released=True, the solutions and videos will populate
# whether to display links to worksheets.

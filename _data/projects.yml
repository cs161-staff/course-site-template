# To add an assignment to the website:
# 1. Upload any necessary files (e.g. starter code) to the assets folder.
# 2. Put the assignment spec in /labs or /projects or /homeworks (if not already there).
# 3. In this file, set "released: true" and add a "link" attribute to
#    display a link to the spec.

# Each element in the array corresponds to one box on the website.
# This includes boxes that are blank or don't have a assignment.

# The website automatically numbers each element in the array.
# To skip numbering (e.g. for a blank box), add "nonumber: True" as an attribute.

# The fields available in each array element that you can use:
# - title:    The text displayed in the box.
#             If blank, uses auto-numbering and displays "Project 1", "Project 2", etc.
#             If not blank, overrides auto-numbering and displays your title. This means
#             your title must do the numbering yourself (e.g. "Project 1A: Deques").
# - link:     Link to the assignment spec.
# - released: Whether the assignment is released yet.
#             Your title links to your link iff "released: true" AND "link" is not blank.
#             This can also be used to show a "not released yet" warning on the top of the spec.
# - due:      If not blank, shows this date on the grid (regardless of release status).
# - parts:    An array of names/links to parts. These appear below the main title/link,
#             with parts separated by slashes.
# - extra:    Write any arbitrary markdown in here if you want to add to the box.
# - rowspan:  How many rows this assignment should take up on the syllabus grid.
# - classes:  You can add an array of classes here to change the color of the box or otherwise
#             format the box. Common colors like "schedule-purple" or "schedule-green"
#             are built-in for you.
# - nonumber: If true, displays the title and nothing else.
#             Also ensures the auto-numbering will not increment from this box.

# Example usage of all of the above:
#
# - title: "Project 1: Deques"
#   link: "/proj1/"
#   released: true
#   due: "09/06"
#   parts:
#     - name: "Part A"
#       link: "/proj1/part-a"
#     - name: "Part B"
#       link: "/proj1/part-b"
#   extra: "[Slides](https://www.google.com)"
#   rowspan: 3
#   classes:
#     - schedule-purple

projects:
  - title: "Project 1"

        link: "/proj1/part-b"
    extra: "[Slides](https://www.google.com)"
    rowspan: 3
    classes:
      - proj1 # adds the purple background

# Where should we start automatically numbering each column?
# For example, if you set starting_homework_number to 0, then the first homework
# assignment you create is numbered HW0. If you set it to 1, then that same
# assignment is numbered HW1 instead.
# You may not need all of these. If your readings are external links and not
# PDFs in the repo, then "starting_readings_number" is irrelevant.
# If you don't have labs, then "starting_lab_number" is irrelevant.

starting_readings_number: '1'
starting_discussion_number: '0'
starting_homework_number: '1'
starting_lab_number: '1'

# Is the first week of class Week 0 or Week 1? We currently don't support
# starting at any other week number, so pick '0' or '1' here.
starting_week_number: '1'

# Change this if you want multiple lecture/discussion/etc boxes on the same day.
# All the other rowspans must be relative to the day rowspan, e.g. a homework 
# spanning 3 days on the calendar would need rowspan 3 * day_rowspan.
# This should be 1 unless you know what you're doing.
day_rowspan: '2'

# How many rows should each assignment take up by default?
# We have one lecture per row. Highly unlikely you'll need to change this.
default_lecture_rowspan: '1'
default_readings_rowspan: '2'
# This probably corresponds to how many rows you have per week, assuming
# you hold discussion once per week. For example, if you have Tu/Th classes
# (two rows per week), then your discussion boxes are probably going to
# take up two rows most of the time, so you'd set default_discussion_rowspan='2'.
# If you have M/W/F classes, though, this might be '3' instead.
default_discussion_rowspan: '4'
# Similar reasoning to discussion, assuming your homeworks/labs are weekly.
default_homework_rowspan: '4'
default_lab_rowspan: '8'
# Project rowspans are too variable, so we just set the default to 1 and
# never use the default (always manually specifying the rowspan).
default_project_rowspan: '1'

# Do you want cells to automatically alternate colors each week?
# Usually the answer is yes/true if the cell appears with a regular fixed
# rowspan, e.g. weekly discussions, weekly homeworks.
# Usually the answer if no/false if cells appear irregularly, e.g. projects
# with long durations that span multiple weeks.

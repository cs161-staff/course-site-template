# This can be used to add extra text in the "Week" column.
# That's the left-most column that usually just has week numbers: 1, 2, 3, etc.
# Example: 61B uses this to add links to weekly surveys.

# Each entry in the week_extra array corresponds to one week box on the grid.
# If you want a week with no annotation, you must explicitly add a blank array entry.

# If you leave both "name" and "link" blank, that week will have no extra text.
# If you fill in "name" only, that week will have "name" as text.
# If you fill in "name" and "link", that week will have "name" linking to "link".
# Filling in "link" only is undefined (it'll just show nothing).

# If you want more than a single name/link, you have to go modify syllabus.html.
# Ctrl+F "week_extra_element" for the place to edit.
# This is not recommended, because the "Week" column isn't really meant for long text.

  - check_ancestors.html is a cursed file.
  - It outputs a variable "ancestor_has_hide_content", which is a Boolean that tells us
    whether or not any of the current page's ancestors has hide_content set to true.
  - It also outputs "ancestor_has_unreleased_warning", which is a Boolean that tells us
    whether or not any of the current page's ancestors has unreleased_warning set to true.

  - If unreleased_warning is true for the current page OR any of the current page's ancestors,
    then show the warning.
    In other words: If ANY ancestor has "unreleased_warning: true", the warning will show.
  - If unreleased_warning is a non-true value (i.e. anything but true) for the current page AND
    for all of the current page's ancestors, then don't show the warning.
    In other words: ALL ancestors must have "unreleased_warning: false" for the warning to not show.
  - If you want rendering to only be controlled by unreleased_warning for the current page and not
    any ancestors, then just delete "or ancestor_has_unreleased_warning == true".
  - For other customization, you can try editing check_ancestors.html though that file is
    cursed and I do not recommend it.

  - If hide_content is true for the current page OR any of the current page's ancestors,
    then render a message and do not render any content.
    In other words: If ANY ancestor has "hide_content: true", the page will not render.
  - If hide_content is a non-true value (i.e. anything but true) for the current page AND
    for all of the current page's ancestors, then render the content as usual.
    In other words: ALL ancestors must have "hide_content: false" for the content to render.
  - If you want rendering to only be controlled by hide_content for the current page and not
    any ancestors, then just delete "or ancestor_has_hide_content == true".
  - For other customization, you can try editing check_ancestors.html though that file is

  - If hide_content is true (for the current page or ANY ancestor page), then override
    any has_right_toc setting and do not render the table of contents.
  - This ensures that if a page is not rendered, its table of contents isn't rendered.
  - If hide_content is not true (for the current page and ALL ancestor pages),
    then preserve the original has_right_toc setting of the current page.

  - If render_right_toc is true, then render a table of contents on the right.
    The table of contents is generated from the page's headers, and has scrollspy enabled.
  - If render_right_toc is any other value, do not render the table of contents.
